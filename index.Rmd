## Knowing your `r fa("questions", fill = "#2c3e50e")``r fa("question", fill = "#2c3e50e")``r fa("question", fill = "#2c3e50e")`

Using data science for social good requires <b>impact-based projects</b> that are built on <b>adequate data</b>.

But above all, we need the <b>expertise of social data scientists</b> who ask the following questions:

--

1. What impact do we want to have with our project? What is the target group?

--

2. What are the challenges and needs of the target group?

--

3. What kind of data is available and how can we access it?

--

4. What should our final product look like? How can we implement it technically?

--

5. Who uses the final product? How often? Which criteria must the product meet to truly add value? 

--

6. And last, but certainly not least: What could potentially go wrong? ðŸ’¥
